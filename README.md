# Supermarket-Inventory-Management
This is a Turbo C++ program. I developed this code for my project in Class 12 CBSE (2019).

The main menu has 3 options: Customer, Administration, Exit.

Customer can place orders from the list of items created by the Administration and generate an invoice.

Administration can add, search, modify, delete, view items.
